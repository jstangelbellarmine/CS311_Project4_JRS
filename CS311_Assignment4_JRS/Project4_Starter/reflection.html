                    <p><strong>To Download or to Link, That was my Question</strong></p>
                    <p>Initially, I had tried to download the Bulma CSS file directly and have that in my project folder, but I ran into a few
                        issues with the file path and getting it to work within my web pages, so I instead went with a link that can acess
                        the CSS file without having to have it in the project folder. 
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>I Realized that I am not Great at Writing CSS Myself</strong></p>
                    <p>My only other experience with CSS was on a very simple biography page from CS-100. (see below) I remember most of the 
                        difficulty then was the CSS file, not rhe HTML. Since we were given such a generous amount of time for this project, I 
                        tried writing my own CSS file to work with the Bulma framework, but my project pages got very uneven and the columns 
                        weren't at all even, so I went back and just stuck with the Bulma framework. In my opinion, it's good to know how to 
                        do it yourself, but when a better product is available, I don't think I should settle for my just-okay CSS writing skills. </p>
                        <p><strong>My Biography Page from CS-100. I'm proud to have come so far since May 28th of this year! Only 6 months ago and 
                            look at my page now! 
                        </strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Predictive Software is a Blessing and a Curse.</strong></p>
                    <p>I used Visual Studio Code for writing my software, and used  Bulma, w3schools, and the linked resources from module 2
                        to write my code. One of the things that kept coming up was the predictive feature of Visual Studio Code to fill in code 
                        that isn't necessary. When editing the bio paragraphs, I didn't catch an open "< p >" and so had to go back and be more discerning. 
                        
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>The Layout of This Page is Intentional</strong></p>
                    <p>This page, with its broken image link and it's column of single text, was how all my websites looked originally. I finally got Verdi's 
                        page layout correctly, and was able to use the same code for the other websites, only changing the information for each. Even the broken
                        image link is intentional! Initially, I hadn't linked the images correctly and had to deal with the error image during development.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Flexbox not Flexing its Design Muscles</strong></p>
                    <p> I wanted to include the Flexbox as a personal challenge for this project, but I played it safe with the modifications. The module's 
                        LiveCode video made a lot more bold choices, but for mine I didn't change it much from one to the other. I liked the wrapping-style 
                        of my text, it made a few sections more visually pleasing, in my opinion. 
                    </p>


                    <p><strong>There's a Secret Entrance to this Page</strong></p>
                    <p> I only figured out how to link pictures to the other parts of this webpage as I was finishing this project. I wanted to include other
                        links to the other pages, but I only programmed a single image-embedded link. If you go to the Home page, you can click on the 
                        singing divas to be taken to this page. Neat =)
